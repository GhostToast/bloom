## Client contact and billing history WordPress plugin

This plugin aims to turn WordPress into a management tool for a therapy office. There are two post types: Clients and Sessions, which may be related via a one to many relationship (a client has many sessions).  

Currently there is no front end, as this is mostly for keeping track of client sessions and (manually) insurance payment status.  

This software is not intended to meet HIPAA compliance and should probably not used on a public-facing website! It may, however, be compliant if ran on a local WordPress installation or on a HIPAA-compliant data center with limited access. This software is offered as-is without warranty. I assume no liability for any HIPAA or confidentiality related nonsense you may or may not get yourself into.

### Roadmap
* More client-based reporting such as...
* ...upcoming birthdays
* ...profit/loss reports
* ...monthly status reports (submitted/paid)
* Support for multiple staff (and tracking this information)
* ???
